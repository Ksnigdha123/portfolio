        <p>Being a front-end developer is a relatively broad term, because there are a lot of different services that are under the giant umbrella of being a front-end developer.  Usually, a developer has several different services that they are an expert at, and an agency has lots of different services.</p>

          <h2>Web Design</h2>
          <p>Basically, the major thing that comes from front-end developers is web design.  We are professionals of making web pages the most functional that they can be, all while making them visually pleasing and aesthetic to the eye.

          <h2>  Redesigning UI and UX</h2>
          <p>If you think that redesigning the user interface of your existing software, a front-end developer would make for a great consultant in the process.  Many agencies that focus on this are busy because it makes sense for a company to constantly look for ways to innovate.

          <h2>Backend</h2>
          <p>I know that this post is focused on what a front-end developer does, but you would be surprised that most agencies with front-end developers also are experienced with the back-end side of things.
